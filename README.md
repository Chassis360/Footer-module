## Why

**Being a fullstack developer i have always had problems with rebuilding simple components and functionalities that are time consuming. The essence of this project is to adapt popular frameworks for reusable component that makes it easier to develop a website**

**Meanwhile I collect most layout and patterns that are popular and remake them as module (sections) that are quick and reusable for web development**
